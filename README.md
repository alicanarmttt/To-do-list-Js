To-Do List Project
This project helped me deepen my understanding of full-stack web development by integrating a frontend interface with a backend API and a SQL database.

Through this project, I gained experience in:

Frontend Development: Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic content updates.
API Integration: Implementing RESTful API calls with Node.js and Express to handle CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) for tasks.
Database Management: Working with SQL Server to persist tasks, using queries to insert, update, and delete data.
Asynchronous Programming: Handling asynchronous requests with the Fetch API for smooth user interactions and real-time task updates.
Error Handling: Ensuring robust error handling in both the frontend and backend for better user experience.
This project enhanced my skills in connecting the frontend and backend, managing dynamic data, and handling user interactions efficiently.
